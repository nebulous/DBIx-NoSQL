NAME
    DBIx::NoSQL - Experimental NoSQL-ish overlay for an SQL database

VERSION
    version 0.0010

SYNOPSIS
        use DBIx::NoSQL;

        my $store = DBIx::NoSQL->new;

        $store->connect( 'store.sqlite' );

        $store->set( 'Artist' => 'Smashing Pumpkins' => {
            name => 'Smashing Pumpkins',
            genre => 'rock',
            website => 'smashingpumpkins.com',
        } );

        $store->search( 'Artist' )->count; # 1

        my $artist = $store->get( 'Artist' => 'Smashing Pumpkins' );

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::NoSQL is a layer over DBI that presents a NoSQLish way to store
    and retrieve data. You do not need to set up a schema beforehand to
    start putting data into your store.

    Currently, it does this by using JSON for serialization and is only
    compatible with SQLite (though additional database support should not
    difficult to implement)

    The API is fairly sane, though still "alpha" quality
