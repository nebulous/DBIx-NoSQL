NAME
    DBIx::NoSQL - Experimental NoSQL-ish overlay for an SQL database

VERSION
    version 0.0010

SYNOPSIS
        use DBIx::NoSQL;

        my $store = DBIx::NoSQL->new;

        $store->connect( 'store.sqlite' );

        $store->set( 'Artist' => 'Smashing Pumpkins' => {
            name => 'Smashing Pumpkins',
            genre => 'rock',
            website => 'smashingpumpkins.com',
        } );

        $store->set( 'Artist' => 'Tool' => {
            name => 'Tool',
            genre => 'rock',
        } );

        $store->search( 'Artist' )->count; # 2

        my $artist = $store->get( 'Artist' => 'Smashing Pumpkins' );

        # Set up a (searchable) index on the name field
        $store->model( 'Artist' )->field( 'name' => ( index => 1 ) );
        $store->model( 'Artist' )->reindex;

        for $artist ( $store->search( 'Artist' )->order_by( 'name DESC' )->all ) {
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::NoSQL is a layer over DBI that presents a NoSQLish way to store
    and retrieve data. You do not need to prepare a schema beforehand to
    start putting data into your store

    Currently, it works by using JSON for serialization and SQLite as the
    database (though additional database support should not difficult to
    implement)

    The API is fairly sane, though still an early "alpha." At the moment, a
    better name for this package might be "DBIx::NoSQLite"
